# progressbarXamarin

how to make an customized indeterminate progressbar. Just run this project and klick on button show 
:)    I hope my project helpp you.

In this example i use new Thread because i not use before another thread,,, but if u have already any thead,, 
u can use existing thread. For example if i will have a thread MyExistingThread  i optimize my code to this:   =>


ThreadPool.MyExistingThread(_ =>
            {
            ///there put whyle loop
            
            }
